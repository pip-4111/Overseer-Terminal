Greetings, Vault Dwellers! 

Feel free to modify and customize for your own projects! I designed this in anticipation of the release of Wand Company's Dye Cast Pip-Boy, If you post any content with it I would appreciate a shoutout however :)
After seeing it could be used to control external devices I knew we all would want a terminal to boot! Connect your Pip-Boy when on the Password page, ensure you have a button bound to enter, and you should get a fun "Connecting external device"
animation allowing you to bypass the password entirely, and you can navigate the hacking screen with arrow keys and enter.


Check back for updates, I plan to continue working on this and refining it further as it is a little janky. Password text and cmd line
are currently just for looks, but feel free to add actual code in order to set a password and command prompt to trigger the hacking
terminal, adding more functionality. 

Struggling to hack the terminal? Password is currently displayed in the console. 

Cheers, and enjoy! 
-Pip
